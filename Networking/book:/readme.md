>Android also uses quite a few open source projects which were of limited popularity in Linux, but form the backbone of its feature set. These projects (in the external/ folder of the AOSP) are largely responsible for implementing Android´s network capabilities, and includ racoon (vpn), mdns (service discovery and Wi-Fi Direct), dnsmasq and hostapd (tethering and Wi-Fi Direct), and wpa_supplicant (Wi-Fi). Other open source projects provide librarylevel support (discussed and shown later in Table 1-3).
